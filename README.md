# TDmatch
=======
TDmatch is a Python library developed to perform matching tasks in three categories:
 * Text to Data which matches tuples of a table to text docuemts
 * Text to Structured text matches hierarchical taxonomy concepts to text docuemtns
 * Text to Text matches two copora of text documents

First, the model creates a graph from document copora, next it trains a word embedding model on random walks generated by tracersing the graph and fainally, by employing the generated model we can match metadata between two corpora.


The repository includes a collection of scripts to generate files needed to perform tasks.
 * `generate_graph.py` generates a graph from two corpora of documents
 * `model_train.py` produces a word embedding model (Word2Vec or Fasttext) from random walks from the generated graph
 * `generate_tests.py` generates matching results by running model for finding similarity between metadata 

We used 4 datasets in testing different tasks:
 * Two fact checking datasets: **Politifact** and **Snopes** which we use for Text to Text matching. These datasets are presented in [That-is-a-Known-Lie](https://github.com/sshaar/That-is-a-Known-Lie)
 * Two datasets for Text to Data matching: **IMDB** which is created form  [IMDB top 250 movies of all time](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating,desc&view=simple). **CoronaCheck** dataset is presented in [Scrutinizer](https://github.com/geokaragiannis/statchecker)
