What the 911 hijackers' wives knew
|Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.|
|The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.|
Illegal immigration costs our country more than 113 billion a year.
|President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.|
|There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after theyve been ordered to leave the United States,including large numbers of violent criminals.|
|Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.|
|You know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.|
|Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.|
Nancy Pelosi has gone out and wants to protect MS-13.

Ambassador Chris Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security. ...Hillary Clintons State Department refused them all.

|Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.|
|Theres "no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from."|
|Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.|
|Hillary took up to 25 million from Saudi Arabia, and much more from others, where being gay is also punishable by death. Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.|
|Shes pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.|
|For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.|
