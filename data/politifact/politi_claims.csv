what the 911 hijackers' wives knew
hillary clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days  and her plan will provide obamacare  social security  and medicare for illegal immigrants  breaking the federal budget.
the truth is  the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. it's always 11 million. our government has no idea. it could be 3 million. it could be 30 million. they have no idea what the number is.
illegal immigration costs our country more than 113 billion a year.
president obama and hillary clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the american people to open borders  and you know it better than anybody right here in arizona. you know it.
there are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after theyve been ordered to leave the united states including large numbers of violent criminals.
since 2013 alone  the obama administration has allowed 300 000 criminal aliens to return back into united states communities. these are individuals encountered or identified by ice  but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.
you know this  this is what they talk about  facing american society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. and  they also think the biggest thing  and you know this  it's not nuclear  and it's not isis  it's not russia  it's not china  it's global warming.
approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never  ever left. why should they? nobody's telling them to leave. stay as long as you want  we'll take care of you.

hillary clinton supported bill clintons totally disastrous nafta  just like she supported chinas entrance into the world trade organization. weve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two hillary-backed agreements were signed.

hillary took up to 25 million from saudi arabia  and much more from others  where being gay is also punishable by death. hillary took millions from kuwait  qatar  oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and lgbt citizens.
shes pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days  end virtually all immigration enforcement  and thus create totally open borders in the united states.
for the amount of money hillary clinton would like to spend on refugees  we could rebuild every inner city in america.
