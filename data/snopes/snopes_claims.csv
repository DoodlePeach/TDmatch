“the need for affordable rural healthcare” = “the need for people who decide to live in rural america to be subsidized by those who choose a more efficient way of life.” rural healthcare should be expensive! and that expense should be borne by those who choose rural america! same goes for rural broadband. and gas taxes. it should be uncomfortable to live in rural america. it should be uncomfortable to not move.  none of the replies i’m getting even *try* to address the central point i’m making: that we shouldn’t make rural life *artificially* cheaper. that’s how you know i’m right. - jackson kernion (@jacksonkernion) november 5  2019
